# G-LNN
This is a warehouse of the data, codes and models of my paper (the methods discussed in this paper mainly based on LPPLS model, an approximation is introduced and based on the approximation, G-LPPLS-NN (G-LNN) is proposed).

G-LPPLS-NN is a model specifically designed for the estimation of critical point distribution.

Most codes will be made available once the paper is accepted.
