# G-LNN
This is a warehouse of the data, codes and models of my paper *Detecting Market Bubbles: A Generalized LPPLS Neural Network Model*, the methods discussed in this paper mainly based on LPPLS model, an approximation is introduced and based on the approximation, G-LPPLS-NN (G-LNN) is proposed).

G-LPPLS-NN is a model specifically designed for the estimation of critical point distribution.

Most codes have been made available, for more information, please reach out to J. Ma.

Note: please make sure that you have MathType installed or have the math font that required by MathType when reading our article in pdf or word format; otherwise, you may encounter errors in the formulas.
